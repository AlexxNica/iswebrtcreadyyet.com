Promoting WebRTC support through the clever use of a website with words on it.

## Developing on this

It's a static site served by github pages but the html is written in jade but comes with a super simple little watcher script. 

Just leave this running and it'll watch for changes on index.jade and complile it ot index.html

Just run:

```
npm i
node watch.js
```
